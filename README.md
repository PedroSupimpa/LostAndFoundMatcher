## Principles Applied
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class and module has a single responsibility.
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The system is open to extension but closed to modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes can replace their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
